\textbf{Freddy} received his Telecommunication Engineer degree from the Universidad de Alcalá (UAH), Spain, in 2013, the M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Information Technology and Communications from the UAH in 2014 and 2019, respectively. Dr. Pinto-Benel held summa cum laude in his doctoral dissertation. Since 2018 he has been working at GMV as signal processing engineer, within the G2G-WO1 project, involved in the design, implementation, validation and test of a mass-market dual-frequency multi-constellation receiver that should be capable of processing the future Galileo second generation signals. Furthermore, since February 2020 he has been leading the signal processing team involved in the development of a DVB-S2 transmitted signal simulator, as well as in their correlation within the project S3TSUP3 with the aim of improving s3t system.\\

\section{ARIFI's project description}
\subsection{Main idea}

To address the proposed idea and achieve our goal, we will focus on how to relate machine learning techniques, field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with the study of the atmosphere by means of satellite data. Thanks to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, we will be able to access to data that will allow us to predict the main atmospheric phenomenons which affects the production of the majority farmers.

In particular, we are talking about reanalysis variables. This kind of data is obtained by some weather forecasting centres, which combine past observations with a modern meteorological forecast model, in order to produce regular gridded datasets of many atmospheric and oceanic variables, with a temporal resolution of a few hours. This datasets usually extend over several decades and cover the entire planet, being a very useful tool for meteorological and climatological studies.

One of the most important reanalysis projects is the {\em ERA-Interim reanalysis project}, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) \cite{ERA_Interim}, which belongs to the Copernicus Programme. ERA-Interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979, continuously updated in real time.

Table \ref{Variables_ERA} is just an example of variables that can be obtained from this platform, which could be used as predictors in machine learning models.

Due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric phenomenons it is so difficult predict with precision its future state. Modeling it without any un- certainty is not possible as there is a strong sensitivity to small perturbations in the initial conditions. But there is a way to overcome this issue by the use of probabilistic weather forecasts \cite{martinez2015forecasting}. In this regard, we propose computational methods belonging to machine learning techniques, a branch of AI, to get predictions or classifications over the main atmospheric factors with high accuracy. We could predict solar radiation, wind velocity, or whatever meteorological process that injures in the farmers' environment. Of course, it would not be possible without GNSS services that provide the essential dataset, as we mentioned before, necessary to train the learning models.

Many of these methods can be classified in the field of Knowledge called “Natural Computing”. The algorithms that can be found in this category are inspired by the way Nature solves complex problems. In this regard, Evolutionary Computation (EC) is inspired in the theory of evolution or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) find their behaviour in human brain.

The conjunction between satellite data and machine learning algorithms will allow us to provide solutions to those aspects that most concern farmers, in order to keep their harvests safe with the highest possible productivity. For instance, if we are able to anticipate how much water they will have at a given time, or to warn of a dry season that was not previously contemplated but, due to the effects produced by climate change may occur, we will have a positive influence on their economy by avoiding unnecessary expenses derived from poor management, because they do not have all the information they could.

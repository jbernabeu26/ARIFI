\section{Introduction}
This proposal aims to present ARIFI to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency's (GSA) contest, named "Farming by Satellite 2020". The latter invites European and African young professionals to contribute to the farming sector, by putting into practice their experience in subjects related to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) combined with their knowledge in agriculture.\\\\%

As a brief introduction, GNSSs are satellite constellations that provide a wide range of services that can be applied in multiple ways. These go from PNT (positioning, navigation and timing) facilities, to earth observation tools and more. Their use has proved to benefit numerous businesses from different sectors, amongst which many have rapidly integrated them to their operations. However, there are other sectors which have not yet exploited GNSS services sufficiently for diverse reasons, either due to lack of funds or to not appealing profitability.\\\\

This proposal pursues the goal of presenting a service, aimed to help the majority of farmers, by providing them with tools to monitor information and know much more about key factors involved in their harvest.

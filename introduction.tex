\section{Introduction}
This proposal aims to present ARIFI to the  \gls{gsa}'s contest, named "Farming by Satellite 2020". The latter invites European and African young professionals to contribute to the farming sector, by putting into practice their experience in subjects related to \gls{gnss} combined with their knowledge in agriculture.\\\\%

As a brief introduction, \gls{gnss}s are satellite constellations that provide a wide range of services that can be applied in multiple ways. These go from \gls{pnt}, to earth observation facilities and more. Their use has proved to benefit numerous businesses from different sectors, amongst which many have rapidly integrated them to their operations. That being said, there are other sectors which have not yet exploited \gls{gnss} services sufficiently for diverse reasons, e.g. due to lack of funds or to not appealing profitability.\\\\

This proposal pursues the goal of presenting an accessible service, aimed to help the majority of farmers, which provides agricultors with a tool that help them manage their fields more efficiently, and to monitor more accurately key factors involved in their harvest.
